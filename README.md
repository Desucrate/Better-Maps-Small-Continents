# better-maps-small-continents
A map script based off the Continents++ script by Gedemon.


Please note that this map script isn't perfect, and you may sometimes get straight edges and boxy generation, but I've done what I can to minimise it.
It is possible to spawn on an island or in an area that does not suit your start bias if your favored biome is left lacking by the map generation; I would not recommend using this map for multiplayer.

Due to the size of the oceans and the possibility of generating smaller landmasses, I recommend playing this map on sizes Large or Huge.
Until those sizes are added by Firaxis, I recommend using YNAMP's Large/Huge.


Creates large landmasses with irregularly shaped coastlines and inland seas, or several medium-sized islands that result in a more naval-focused game.
Overall shape of continents will be far less blobby.

Oceans will consistently be quite vast. Coastlines will create multiple spines through inland seas, some of which will lead to faraway islands, while some will lead only to a dead end.

Reaching the Distant Lands in Exploration Age will generally be 4-5~ tiles of open ocean, and controlling land close to an easy passage may be rewarding.

Additionally, the map will randomise the location of the equator for each map, changing the height of the temperature belts by up to 30Â° latitude.
Biome generation has been mildly adjusted to reduce how far north desert can go (though it should not affect overall size and presence of desert, for viability of leaders/civs like Amina)

Compatible with YNAMP and any other map script.
